This is a fork. When writing new features you should endeavor to alter upstream-owned files as little as possible, to minimize future conflict.

You can determine which files are unique to the fork (and thus free to edit), by calling invoking `forklift files` from bash.

When making changes, you **MUST** update this file to reflect anything new, updated, or removed.

## Auto-fixing Lints

`bun fix` will

* If it fails, check the logs, but be aware that a `bun fix:ts` will fix some of the easier issues that you're likely to encounter.

## Fork feature set

This fork adds the following feature areas on top of upstream:

### Agent workflow and submission handling
- Multi-block submissions in interactive mode
- Fenced multi-block shortcut syntax
- Streaming multi-block queue ordering so prompt text and command results stay in authored order
- Execute-intent paste for explicit executable clipboard input

### Runtime and session behavior
- Native `.omp` live reload for commands and skills
- `/reload` support for refreshing runtime state
- Codex OAuth account stickiness per session / top-level agent
- Fork-local Codex account selection: keep reusing a still-usable sticky pin to avoid cache churn; when a new pin is needed, prefer Spark/Pro accounts first, then choose the non-exhausted account whose long window renews soonest; fail fast if Codex ranking data is missing so regressions surface immediately.
- Codex affinity and cache-observability logging
- Fork-local assistant token line in interactive mode: when `display.showTokenUsage` is enabled, assistant messages show dim input/output counts, then a `\uf49b` cache segment with explicit cached-token count including `0` and hit/miss tinting, then a trailing `` elapsed segment derived from assistant-message timestamps in compact `d/h/m/s` form; zero-cache responses tint both cache and elapsed segments as misses so the line stays visually consistent
- Native shell interpolation in rendered command and skill bodies

### Supporting platform and tooling changes
- Better extension discovery, including symlinked package dirs
- Package name derivation fixes for discovered extensions
- Session token tracking and related session-link fixes
- Clipboard and native integration improvements
- Nano Banana 2 image-generation pipeline upgrade
- OpenRouter image-generation requests now send `modalities` and forward `image_config` (`aspect_ratio`, `image_size`) when provided
- Fork-local bundled Danger Pi extensions now live in `packages/coding-agent/src/danger-pi/extensions/index.ts` and are wired directly into `sdk.ts` inline extensions, separate from filesystem-discovered user/project extensions
- Added fork-local `meta` bundled extension slash command for UI/autocomplete experimentation with `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` argument suggestions
